Welcome fellow mathematics enthusiasts!  I'm very excited to be your teacher
for PCHA this year!  This is a fast-moving course, and we will cover a wide
variety of interesting topics on the way to calculus, the development of which
was a major milestone in human understanding of the universe.

As we visit these topics, we will also do some coding to aid our understanding
of these mathematical concepts, to see some of the relationships between
mathematics and computer science, and to have fun and enjoy our mathematical
skills.
