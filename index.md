Welcome fellow mathematics enthusiasts!  I'm very excited to be your teacher
for PCHA this year!  This is a fast-moving course, and we will cover a wide
variety of interesting topics on the way to calculus, the development of which
was a major milestone in human understanding of the universe.

As we visit these topics, we will also do some coding to aid our understanding
of these mathematical concepts, to see some of the relationships between
mathematics and computer science, and to have fun and enjoy our mathematical
skills.

Here's a fun quote from an article "Calculus Is Good for You"
that appeared in _Scientific American_ in 1871 (150 years ago!).

> It is admitted by all metaphysicians and educators that the calculus brings
> into play more faculties of the mind than any other branch of learning.
> Recognizing this fact, professors should consider their institution a mental
> gymnasium, which gives the mind exercise that enables it to perform its highest
> destiny. Herein is the value of solving problems in the calculus, and indeed of
> all other branches of pure mathematicsâ€”that by dealing in abstract ideas, they
> prepare the mind to apply itself vigorously to profound or complicated subjects
> connected with the realities of life."
