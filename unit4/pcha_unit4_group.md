__1.__ Let 
$$
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
        x & \text{if } x<0 \\
        2-(x-1)^2 & \text{if } x\geq 0 \\
    \end{cases}
$$

a) Sketch the graph of $f(x)$.

\vspace{2in}

b) On what intervals is $f$ increasing and/or decreasing?  Is $f$
bounded?  Does it have any local or global maxima or minima?

\vspace{1in}

c) Does $f$ have any discontinuities?  Where, and what type?

\vspace{1in}

d) Describe the end behavior of $f$ using limits.

\newpage

__2.__ Consider the same function from the previous problem.
$$
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
        x & \text{if } x<0 \\
        -(x-1)^2 & \text{if } x\geq 0 \\
    \end{cases}
$$

Sketch the graphs of the following transformed functions:

* $p(x) = f(-x)$
* $q(x) = f(|x|)$
* $r(x) = |f(|x|)|$
* $s(x) = |f(-x)|$
* $t(x) = -f(-|x|)$

__3.__ Factor the following polynomial completely, both over
$\mathbb{R}$ (as a product of real linear and irreducible
quadratic factors) and over $\mathbb{C}$ (as a product of complex
linear factors).  Sketch the graph of the function.

$$p(x) = -2x^3 + 7x^2 + 17x - 10$$

\newpage

__4.__ Factor the following polynomial completely, both over
$\mathbb{R}$ (as a product of real linear and irreducible
quadratic factors) and over $\mathbb{C}$ (as a product of complex
linear factors).  Sketch the graph of the function.  A little
bird tells you that $2+3i$ is a zero.

$$q(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 10x^2 + 12x - 39$$

\newpage

__5.__ Sketch the graph of the following rational function:
$$ r(x) = \dfrac{x^2-3x+2}{(x^2-4x+4)(x-3)} $$
