__Unit 3 Coding Project__  
__PCHA 2021-22 / Dr. Kessner__  

## Coding Project

This project is a opportunity for you to be creative with your new knowledge of
parametric equations and polar graphs.

Your assignment is to create an image using Python turtle graphics.  You can
make whatever you like.  It can be simple: flowers or a house, or something
abstract.

You can work with classmates on your code.  However, your final images should
be different (see criteria below).

[Python Turtle Graphics documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)


## Criteria

For full credit, you must:

* Submit both code and screenshot(s).  You are welcome to do more than one.  To
  submit, please create a folder with your name inside the ```coding_project```
  shared folder.

* Use at least 4 different parametric equations to draw curves.  If you work
  with classmates, at least two of these should be different from theirs.

* Use comments on larger blocks of code to describe what your code is doing. 

* Use comments to indicate any shared code.

* __Individual Bonus__:  Figure out how to draw a lemniscate (infinity curve)
  using the equation $r^2 = a^2 \cos(2\theta)$, and include it in your image.
  No sharing on this one!

* Have fun!
