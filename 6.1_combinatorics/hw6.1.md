$_3 P_2$

$_3 P_3$

$_4 P_1$  

$_4 P_2$

$_4 P_3$

$_4 P_4$

$\dbinom{2}{2}$  

$\dbinom{3}{0}$  

$\dbinom{3}{1}$

__3.__ How many pizzas can you make with 12 toppings?


__4.__ How many ways can you pick 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place from 8 contestants?
How many ways can you pick a committee of 3 from 8 people?

__5.__ You have 6 dogs and 4 cats.  You decide to organize a dog parade for
your favorite 5 dogs, so you need to line up 5 dogs (in order of preference),
and you need to pick two cats to be official Dog Herders to keep the dogs in
line.  How many ways can you do this?

__6.__ How many subsets does a set of size 7 have?  How many binary sequences
are there with length 8?

__7.__ How many license plates have the form #AAA###, i.e. a digit followed by 3 
letters, followed by 3 digits?

__8.__  A sequence of DNA can be thought of as a sequence of letters from an
alphabet of size 4: $\{A, C, G, T\}$.  
A _codon_ is a sequence of length 3.  For
example, AAA, ACT, and TTG are all codons.  How many possible codons are there?

__9.__ A protein is a sequence of amino acids, of which there are 20 types, so you can
think of a protein as a sequence of letters from an alphabet of size 20.  How many
possible proteins are there of length 10?

__10.__ How many 4 letter words are possible using the English alphabet?
