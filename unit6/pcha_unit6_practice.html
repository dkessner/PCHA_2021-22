<p><strong>Discrete Math Practice</strong><br />
<strong>PCHA 2021-22 / Dr. Kessner</strong></p>

<p><strong>No calculator unless its an emergency. Have fun!</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Evaluate:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\dbinom{8}{0}\)</span> </p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\dbinom{8}{1}\)</span> </p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\dbinom{8}{2}\)</span> </p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\dbinom{8}{3}\)</span> </p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\dbinom{8}{6}\)</span> </p></li>
<li><p>You have 8 dogs and 5 cats. How many ways can you pick a committee of 3 dogs and 2 cats?<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>You still have 8 dogs and 5 cats. How many ways can you rank your top 3 cats and top 3 dogs? </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Phone numbers have the format <code>(xxx)yyy-zzzz</code>. For both the area code <code>xxx</code> and exchange <code>yyy</code>, the first digit is not allowed to be 0 or 1.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>How many possible phone numbers are there?</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Some phone numbers are not available for standard telephones. In particular, the numbers 555-0100 through 555-0199 (in any area code) are reserved for fictional use. In addition, the N11 numbers (e.g. 911, 411) are also reserved, so these are not usable for the exchange <code>yyy</code>. Considering these two restrictions, how many phone numbers are available for telephones?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>3.</strong> You have 11 possible toppings you could put on your pizza.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>How many different pizzas could you make?</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Your favorite number is 9. How many different pizzas can you make using exactly 9 of the 11 toppings?</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>You pick a random pizza from the set of all possible different pizzas. What is the probability that it has exactly 9 toppings?</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>You pick a random pizza from the set of all possible different pizzas. What is the probability that it has exactly 10 toppings?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>4.</strong> a. Expand and write in standard form: <span class="math inline">\((-3x+y)^4\)</span>.</p>

<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Find the coefficient of the <span class="math inline">\(x^2 y^6\)</span> term in the expansion of <span class="math inline">\((-2y+x)^8\)</span>.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>5.</strong> a. How many ways can you choose a random 5-letter word? Assume that the alphabet has the usual 26 letters, and a word is any sequence of letters, whether you can pronounce it or not.</p>

<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Suppose you pick a random 5 letter word. What is the probability of picking the word <code>PROOF</code>?</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>Assume that the letter <code>y</code> is a vowel, so there are 6 vowels and 20 consonants in the alphabet. What is the probability of picking a word having the form <code>XXOOX</code>, where <code>X</code> is a consonant and <code>O</code> is a vowel?</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>What is the probability that a random 5-letter word has exactly 2 vowels? <em>Hint:</em> In part (c) you calculate the probability of picking a word with vowels in the 3rd and 4th positions. But a random word may have exactly 2 vowels in some other positions. How many ways can you pick 2 positions to be vowels from the 5 positions?</li>
</ol>
