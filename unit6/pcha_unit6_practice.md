__1.__  Evaluate:

a. $\dbinom{8}{0}$
\vspace{.5in}

b. $\dbinom{8}{1}$
\vspace{.5in}

c. $\dbinom{8}{2}$
\vspace{.5in}

d. $\dbinom{8}{3}$
\vspace{.5in}

e. $\dbinom{8}{6}$
\vspace{.5in}

f. You have 8 dogs and 5 cats.  How many ways can you pick a committee of 3
dogs and 2 cats?  
\vspace{.5in}

g. You still have 8 dogs and 5 cats.  How many ways can you rank your top 3 cats and top 3 dogs?

__2.__ Phone numbers have the format `(xxx)yyy-zzzz`.  For both the area code
`xxx` and exchange `yyy`, the first digit is not allowed to be 0 or 1.

a. How many possible phone numbers are there?  

\vspace{3in}

b. Some phone numbers are not available for standard telephones.  In
particular, the numbers 555-0100 through 555-0199 (in any area code) are
reserved for fictional use.  In addition, the N11 numbers (e.g. 911, 411) are
also reserved, so these are not usable for the exchange `yyy`.  Considering
these two restrictions, how many phone numbers are available for telephones?

__3.__  You have 11 possible toppings you could put on your pizza.  

a. How many different pizzas could you make?

\vspace{2in}

b. Your favorite number is 9.  How many different pizzas can you
make using exactly 9 of the 11 toppings?

\vspace{2in}

c. You pick a random pizza from the set of all possible different
pizzas.  What is the probability that it has exactly 9 toppings?

\vspace{2in}

d. You pick a random pizza from the set of all possible different
pizzas.  What is the probability that it has exactly 10 toppings?

\newpage


__5.__ a. Expand and write in standard form: $(-3x+y)^4$.


\vspace{4in}


b. Find the coefficient of the $x^2 y^6$ term in the expansion of $(-2y+x)^8$.

__5.__ a. How many ways can you choose a random 5-letter word?  Assume that the
alphabet has the usual 26 letters, and a word is any sequence of letters,
whether you can pronounce it or not.

\vspace{2in}

b. Suppose you pick a random 5 letter word.  What is the probability of picking
the word `PROOF`? 

\vspace{2in}

c. Assume that the letter `y` is a vowel, so there are 6 vowels and 20
consonants in the alphabet.  What is the probability of picking a word having
the form `XXOOX`, where `X` is a consonant and `O` is a vowel?

\vspace{2in}

d. What is the probability that a random 5-letter word has exactly
2 vowels?  _Hint:_ In part (c) you calculate the probability of
picking a word with vowels in the 3rd and 4th positions.  But a
random word may have exactly 2 vowels in some other positions.
How many ways can you pick 2 positions to be vowels from the 5
positions?
