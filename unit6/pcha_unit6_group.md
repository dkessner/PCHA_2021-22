__2.__ Let $\{a_k\}_{k=1}^\infty = \{ \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, -\frac{1}{16}, \cdots\}$.

a. What type of sequence is this?  Write recursive and explicit formulas for $a_k$.

\vspace{2in}

b. Let $S_n$ be the $n^\text{th}$ partial sum of the sequence $\{a_k\}$.  Express
$S_n$ (for this particular sequence) in summation notation.

\vspace{2in}

c. Write a formula for the actual sum $S_n$ (for this particular sequence).

\vspace{2in}

d. What is the sum of the infinite series 
$\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{16} + \cdots$?  (Surprising?)


\newpage

__3.__ Expand $(2-x^2)^4$.

\vspace{3in}

Find the $x^6$ term in $(2-x^2)^5$.

\vspace{3in}

Find the $x^8$ term in $(2-x^2)^5$.

__4.__  Suppose you have 7 red and 3 white marbles in a bag.  You pick 6 of the
marbles from the bag (without replacement).  

a. What is the probability that you pick 6 red marbles?

\vspace{2in}

b. What is the probability that you pick 4 red (and 2 white marbles)?

\vspace{2in} 

c. What is the probability that you pick 2 red marbles?



\newpage

__5.__  Suppose you have 50 black and 50 white marbles in a bag.  You sample 5
marbles with replacement (in other words, you pick a marble, look at it, and
put it back, 5 times).  Let B be the number of times you pick a black marble.
Calculate all of the 6 probabilities $P(B=0), P(B=1), ..., P(B=5)$.  _Hint:_
You only have to calculate half of these.  Verify that $1 = \sum_{k=0}^{5}
P(B=k)$.

\vspace{4in}

Now suppose you have 75 black and 25 white marbles in the bag.  You again
sample 5 marbles with replacement.  Calculate the probabilities $P(B=0),
P(B=1), ...,  P(B=5)$ and again verify that $1 = \sum_{k=0}^{5} P(B=k)$.
